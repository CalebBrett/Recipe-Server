Vision: To make a device that can store and display recipies.

Base features:
   - Display ingredients and recipies
   - Easy to press physical buttons to navigate cooking instructions when hands are dirty in middle of cooking
   - Edit recipie list remotely
   - Scalable portions
   - Export shopping list to grocery rewards points app
Extra features (WIP):
   - Meal + leftovers planner (calendar type thing)
   - Expiry tracker
   - Given list of ingredients give meal possibilities (kinda hard to keep updated) maybe easy presets
   - General tips and tricks for prep when an ingredient appears
   - Add tools needed (stove, 1cup measure, table spoon etc.) could eventually use to optimize cooking meals in parallel
   - Group ingredients and align with the step in instructions where needed
