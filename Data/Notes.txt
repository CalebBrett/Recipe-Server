Backend:
Database for recipies -> relational ingredients and instructions -> what i have at home -> expiery timers + done meals
Grocery store rewards points app script take ingredients for upcoming recipies and export to grocery store rewards points app format and import into grocery store rewards points website ** grocery store rewards points website no longer has this feature so now will copy ingredient list to clipboard to paste into notes app/email

Front end:
On external connection -> add/edit recipies -> que up next session (with scaling) -> export next session to grocery store rewards points app shopping list
On device -> List of recipies sorted by meal type and oldest unused -> choose one or more to add to current session or start session if done on external conneted device -> view current session and move between 1 or more recipies -> for each show ingredients and instrucitons (with scaling not really needed but good incase need to scale at time of cooking)

Buttons that I can hit with elbow (messy hands) to navigate while cooking:
Scroll up and down buttons
Cycle back and forth between group of few recipies buttons
Changed view (side by side or single) button
Maybe 2 extra buttons for extra features (maybe not because done and scaling can all be done from the touch screen and wont be needed while cooking)
